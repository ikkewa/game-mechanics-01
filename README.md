# GameMechanic 01 "Movement" with Phaser.io

## Intro

I am testing and playing around with [Phaser.io](http://www.phaser.io) Game Framework.
The examples developed are simple and just pieces to construct a full game. It is more about the process, rather then the result.

This repository is about Movement in games. The related (german) Blogpost will follow.
The result what this state will provide can be found on several other blogpost and in the phaser examples folder itself.


## Install

To try this in you own, you need to pull the Git repository and run npm install. The environment is based around my phaser yeoman generator, which can be found [here](https://github.com/ikkewa/generator-phaser-alt). It will include everything to get a decent workflow running based on server great NodeJS tools.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ikkewa/game-mechanics-01
npm install

gulp
```
